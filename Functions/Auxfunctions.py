def generateUserID():
    '''
    generate a user ID

    The system then needs to automatically add the registration date and assign a unique membership ID to every new member. The membership ID is a string of 10 random digits, not allowed to start with a Zero. The last digit on the right is a checksum digit, which must be equal to the remainder of the sum of the first 9 digits by 10.

    Few examples are given below:

    ยง Invalid ID number: 0223287420 [a Zero at index 0 is not allowed]

    ยง Invalid ID number: 5223287424 [The checksum is not correct]
    > (5+2+2+3+2+8+7+4+2) = 35 35 mod 10 = 5 ยน 4

    ยง Valid ID number: 5223287425
